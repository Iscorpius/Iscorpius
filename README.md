- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Iscorpius
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in venturing anything related to computer specially programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nodejs, javascript, and typescript
- ðŸ“« I understand the basic fundamentals and principle of Java, Python, C/C++/C# and HTML/CSS/Javascript

I understand that it's not pretty good to learn more than 1 language at once and it is better to learn one at a time but so far, I feel like I'm doing just fine.

List of finished project:
- Point-of-Sale system with Java using Intellij
- Discord Bot
- Minecraft plugin
- E-commerce website with HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP

List of plan project
- Discord Bot using the latest Discord API module in Javascript, specially with slash commands.
- Inventory System that can be use in small establishment.
- Creating a game. I don't have anything on my mind at the moment.
- Creating a mobile app.
